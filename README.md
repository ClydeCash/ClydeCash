- 👋 Hi, I’m @ClydeCash
- 👀 I’m interested in things that interest me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of things, but fewer than I previously had to.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I'm chill.
- 📫 How to reach me? Don't. If you must: gregg_with3gs@proton.me
- 😄 Pronouns: Whatever you use to refer to a man in the language being spoken.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm the world's greatest philosopher.
